# Log fake for Laravel

A bunch of Laravel facades / services are able to be faked, such as the Dispatcher with `Bus::fake()`, to help with testing and assertions. This package gives you the ability to fake the logger in your app, and includes the ability to make assertions against channels, stacks, and a whole bunch more.

## Installation

You can install using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
composer require timacdonald/log-fake --dev
```

## Basic usage

```php
public function testItLogsWhenAUserAuthenticates()
{
    /*
     * Test setup.
     *
     * In the setup of your tests, you can call the following `bind` helper,
     * which will switch out the underlying log driver with the fake.
     */
    LogFake::bind();

    /*
     * Application implementation.
     *
     * In your application's implementation, you then utilise the logger, as you
     * normally would.
     */
    Log::info('User logged in.', ['user_id' => $user->id]);

    /*
     * Test assertions.
     *
     * Finally you can make assertions against the log channels, stacks, etc. to
     * ensure the expected logging occurred in your implementation.
     */
    Log::channel('stack')->assertLogged(fn (LogEntry $log) =>
        $log->level === 'info'
        && $log->message === 'User logged in.' 
        && $log->context === ['user_id' => 5]
    );
}
```

## Channels

If you are logging to a specific channel (i.e. not the default channel) in your app, you need to also prefix your assertions in the same manner.

```php
public function testItLogsWhenAUserAuthenticates()
{
    // setup...
    LogFake::bind();

    // implementation...
    Log::channel('slack')->info('User logged in.', ['user_id' => $user->id]);

    // assertions...
    Log::channel('slack')->assertLogged(
        fn (LogEntry $log) => $log->message === 'User logged in.'
    );
}
```

## Stacks

If you are logging to a stack in your app, like with channels, you will need to prefix your assertions. Note that the order of the stack does not matter.

```php
public function testItLogsWhenAUserAuthenticates()
{
    // setup...
    LogFake::bind();

    // implementation...
    Log::stack(['stderr', 'single'])->info('User logged in.', ['user_id' => $user->id]);

    // assertions...
    Log::stack(['stderr', 'single'])->assertLogged(
        fn (LogEntry $log) => $log->message === 'User logged in.'
    );
}
```

That's it really. Now let's dig into the available assertions to improve your experience testing your applications logging.

## Available assertions

Remember that all assertions are relative to the channel or stack as shown above.

- [`assertLogged()`](#assertlogged)
- [`assertLoggedTimes()`](#assertloggedtimes)
- [`assertNotLogged()`](#assertnotlogged)
- [`assertNothingLogged()`](#assertnothinglogged)
- [`assertWasForgotten()`](#assertwasforgotten)
- [`assertWasForgottenTimes()`](#assertwasforgottentimes)
- [`assertWasNotForgotten()`](#assertwasnotforgotten)
- [`assertChannelIsCurrentlyForgotten()`](#assertchanneliscurrentlyforgotten)
- [`assertCurrentContext()`](#assertcurrentcontext)

Log::assertChannelIsCurrentlyForgotten('stderr'); // ❌ as the `single` channel was forgotten, not the `stderr` channel.
```

### assertCurrentContext()

Assert that the channel currently has the specified context. It is possible to provide the expected context as an array or alternatively you can provide a truth-test closure to check the current context.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base (default channel)
- [x] Channels
- [ ] Stacks

#### Example tests

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::withContext([
    'app' => 'Acme CRM',
]);

Log::withContext([
    'env' => 'production',
]);

/*
 * assertions...
 */

Log::assertCurrentContext([
    'app' => 'Acme CRM',
    'env' => 'production',
]); // ✅

Log::assertCurrentContext(
    fn (array $context) => $context['app'] === 'Acme CRM')
); // ✅

Log::assertCurrentContext([
    'env' => 'production',
]); // ❌ missing the "app" key.

Log::assertCurrentContext(
    fn (array $context) => $context['env'] === 'develop')
); // ❌ the 'env' key is set to "production"
```

### assertHasSharedContext()

Assert that the Log manager currently has the given shared context. It is possible to provide the expected context as an array or alternatively you can provide a truth-test closure to check the current context.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base (default channel)
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Stacks

#### Example tests

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::shareContext([
    'invocation-id' => '54',
]);

/*
 * assertions...
 */

Log::assertHasSharedContext([
    'invocation-id' => '54',
]); // ✅

Log::assertCurrentContext(
    fn (array $context) => $context['invocation-id'] === '54')
); // ✅

Log::assertCurrentContext([
    'invocation-id' => '99',
]); // ❌ wrong invocation ID

Log::assertCurrentContext(
    fn (array $context) => $context['invocation-id'] === '99')
); // ❌ wrong invocation ID
```

## Inspection

Sometimes when debugging tests it's useful to be able to take a peek at the messages that have been logged. There are a couple of helpers to assist with this.

### dump()

Dumps all the logs in the channel. You can also pass a truth-based closure to filter the logs that are dumped.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base (default channel)
- [x] Channels
- [x] Stacks

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::info('User logged in.');

Log::channel('slack')->alert('Stripe request initiated.');

/*
 * inspection...
 */

Log::dump();

// array:1 [
//   0 => array:4 [
//     "level" => "info"
//     "message" => "User logged in."
//     "context" => []
//     "channel" => "stack"
//   ]
// ]

Log::channel('slack')->dump();

// array:1 [
//   0 => array:4 [
//     "level" => "alert"
//     "message" => "Stripe request initiated."
//     "context" => []
//     "channel" => "slack"
//   ]
// ]
```

### dd()

The same as [`dump`](https://github.com/timacdonald/log-fake#dump), but also ends the execution.

### dumpAll()

Dumps the logs for all channels. Also accepts a truth-test closure to filter any logs.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base ~(default channel)~
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Stacks

#### Example usage

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::info('User logged in.');

Log::channel('slack')->alert('Stripe request initiated.');

/*
 * inspection...
 */

Log::dumpAll();

// array:2 [
//   0 => array:4 [
//     "level" => "info"
//     "message" => "User logged in."
//     "context" => []
//     "times_channel_has_been_forgotten_at_time_of_writing_log" => 0
//     "channel" => "stack"
//   ]
//   1 => array:4 [
//     "level" => "alert"
//     "message" => "Stripe request initiated."
//     "context" => []
//     "times_channel_has_been_forgotten_at_time_of_writing_log" => 0
//     "channel" => "slack"
//   ]
// ]
```

### ddAll()

The same as [`dumpAll()`](https://github.com/timacdonald/log-fake#dumpall), but also ends the execution.

## Other APIs

### logs()

Get a collection of all log entries from a channel or stack.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base (default channel)
- [x] Channels
- [x] Stacks

#### Example usage

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::channel('slack')->info('User logged in.');

Log::channel('slack')->alert('Stripe request initiated.');

/*
 * example usage...
 */

$logs = Log::channel('slack')->logs();

assert($logs->count() === 2); ✅
```

### allLogs()

Similar to [`logs()`](https://github.com/timacdonald/log-fake#logs), except that it is called on the Facade base and returns a collection of logs from all the channels and stacks.

#### Can be called on

- [x] Facade base ~(default channel)~
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Stacks

#### Example usage

```php
/*
 * implementation...
 */

Log::info('User logged in.');

Log::channel('slack')->alert('Stripe request initiated.');

/*
 * example usage...
 */

$logs = Log::allLogs();

assert($logs->count() === 2); ✅
```
